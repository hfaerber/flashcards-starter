# FlashCards Game

## Project Details
This solo project was completed the first week of Mod 2.  The objective was to
build a flashcard game from a partially built code-base to be played in the
terminal.  This project required implementation of ES6 classes and
implementation of a testing suite using Test Driven Development, as well as use
of a linter.  In addition to these new implementations, this project focused on
clean, DRY code and SRP.

## How To Play
When you're ready to play, run `node index.js` from the root directory of the
project.

The game includes 30 questions and will tell you after each question whether
your answer was correct.

At the end of the round it will tell you what percentage of questions you
answered correctly.

To exit game play after or during the game, use `control + C`.  Have fun!
